	<h1>Safety Guide</h1>
	<h2>Beware-Use Your Judgement</h2>
	<p>It is in the interests of a user to exercise his/her best judgment to assess properties' and owners' authenticity. The claims being made may or may not be correct, a user is therefore advised to independently verify the authenticity of the claims being made. To this end, we have compiled a checklist which may help a user avoid deceit. We recommend that all our users MUST go through the checklist (mentioned below) prior to purchasing or renting a house.</p>
	<h3>For A Buyer/Investor</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The buyer should conduct checks and establish authenticity of any property, or project, its title, built up area, suitability for buying in a form and manner deemed appropriate at his or her cost.</li>
	<li>makanmalik.com being an advertising medium does not and can not vouch for authenticity of content on its site. A lot of content is uploaded by the advertiser and we do not filter or verify the same. If a complaint is made, we will take remedial measures.</li>
	<li>Conduct a comprehensive check of ownership to verify developer's/owners' credentials.</li>
	<li>Visit the project site/property personally, to ensure that the broker's or developer's claim is genuine and that the property is not an 'imaginary' one.</li>
	<li>Opt for a builder with good track record, checking the past record of the promoters may be helpful.</li>
	<ii>Beware of false title documents. Loans may have been secured against properties that may be disputed or have remained vacant for long.</li>
	<li>It is always advisable that proper due diligence on the property is conducted prior to entering into a transaction related to a real estate.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind that open areas - lobby, park, terrace, pool, gymnasium, and lift/elevator - are not a part of Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR).</li>
	<li>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016 and its related provisions and their applicability to the project.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>For A Tenant</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Visit the accommodation/property and meet the landlord.</li>
	<li>Check all the rooms, including the kitchen and bath area for plumbing problems, such as fixture leaks and seepages, clogged drains and pipelines.</li>
	<li>Find out about the security deposit in a particular area before making the payment. Unscrupulous individuals may ask for unjustified amounts of money.</li>
	<li>Ascertain access, safety and security.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>How to Avoid Real Estate Fraud?</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>Do not wire money to a 'supposed landlord/owner' you have not met personally.</li>
	<li>In case a broker is showing you the property, make sure that you meet the owner or have a web session with him.</li>
	<li>Do not handover any part of the consideration/rent to the broker.
	<li>Be wary of disputed land titles.</li>
    	<li>Be suspicious of realty investments promising high returns (due to infra development) with little/no risk.</li>
    <li>Visit the property personally to check the interior and exterior condition; conduct due diligence.</li>
    <li>Opt for properties that have at least 3-4 clear photos of bedrooms, bath and kitchen area.</li>
    <li>Familiarise yourself with the neighbourhood, before moving in.</li>
    <li>Talk to some neighbours and make sure that the one who is showing you the property is the actual owner.</li>
</ul>
